This project demonstrates the usage of an SSD1306 OLED display interfaced with an STM32F103 microcontroller, featuring button input and ADC reading functionality. The system includes multiple RTOS threads to handle different tasks such as reading button inputs, fetching ADC values, and displaying data on both the OLED display and UART console.
